In particular, handling medical records is the major focus of this Python Django hospital management system project. The system also shows all of the appointments that are available along with their associated information.
The system also enables management of patient records. Evidently, the three sections of this project are Patient, Doctor, and Admin Panel.
A patient can easily register and begin using this web program, according to an overview of it. Initially, the admin must approve the action. In actuality, he or she must apply for it.
However, the administrator must take action on each application, which is contingent on their approval or disapproval. Every patient is required to describe their symptoms by default. The client can also examine their appointment and hospital expenses.

Admin Dashboard
An admin, on the other hand, has total command over the platform. In contrast to every other user, an admin account controls the system’s correct operation. The user can view a summary of all the data. The admin has the authority to accept or reject each request.
The admin can only schedule an appointment and release patients, by the way. However, the administrative staff can continue with the patient bills’ billing portion. An admin must provide information such as room charges, doctor fees with medication, and other charges in order to add billings.
The user can examine and download bill receipts in addition, though. The user can also list the records of the patient and the doctor.
In addition to these, the system provides a list of overall records for all applicants across various categories. In actuality, these sections also contain declined and pending records. The admin can also oversee all appointments.
